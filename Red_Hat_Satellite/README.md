# **Red Hat Satellite** often comes up in interviews, especially for **Linux admin / DevOps / sysadmin** roles where large-scale RHEL environments are managed.

---

# 🔹 What is Red Hat Satellite?

👉 **Red Hat Satellite** is a **system management platform** from Red Hat used to deploy, configure, and maintain **Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) systems at scale**.

Think of it as a **centralized management tool** for hundreds or thousands of RHEL servers.

It automates:

* **Provisioning** (installing OS & configuring servers)
* **Configuration management** (using Puppet/Ansible)
* **Patch management** (security updates & bug fixes)
* **Subscription management** (managing Red Hat licenses)
* **Monitoring & reporting**

---

## 🔹 Core Components of Red Hat Satellite

1. **Content Management**

   * Sync RHEL packages & updates from Red Hat CDN.
   * Mirror repositories (yum, rpm).
   * Distribute software content to servers.

2. **Provisioning**

   * Kickstart bare-metal servers or VMs with RHEL.
   * Integration with VMware, AWS, OpenStack, bare-metal PXE boot.
   * Automated host registration.

3. **Configuration Management**

   * Uses **Ansible** (earlier Puppet) to enforce configuration.
   * Apply consistent policies across servers.

4. **Patch Management**

   * Roll out **security & bug fixes**.
   * Stage updates in **Lifecycle Environments** (Development → QA → Production).

5. **Subscription & License Management**

   * Track and allocate Red Hat subscriptions across servers.
   * Prevent “out of subscription” issues.

6. **Monitoring & Reporting**

   * Compliance scanning.
   * Reports on patches, security, and performance.

---

## 🔹 Architecture Overview

* **Satellite Server** → Central management console (web UI & CLI).
* **Capsule Server** → Proxy server to manage remote sites/datacenters (acts like a content and provisioning relay).
* **Hosts (Clients)** → RHEL systems registered to Satellite.

👉 Analogy: **Satellite = Control Tower**, **Capsule = Remote Outposts**, **Hosts = Airplanes**.

## 🔹 Common Interview Questions on Red Hat Satellite

1. **What is Red Hat Satellite and why is it used?**
   → To manage RHEL systems at scale (provisioning, patching, configuration, subscriptions).

2. **Difference between Satellite 5 and Satellite 6?**

   * Satellite 5 → based on Spacewalk (older).
   * Satellite 6 → redesigned, based on **Foreman, Katello, Candlepin, and Pulp**.

3. **What are Capsules in Satellite?**

7. **How do you register a host to Satellite?**

   * Use `subscription-manager register` with org + activation key.
   * Host reports to Satellite for updates/configuration.

8. **How does Satellite help with compliance/security?**
   → Provides OpenSCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) scanning and compliance reporting.

9. **What are Activation Keys in Satellite?**
   → Pre-defined templates to register new systems with correct subscriptions, repos, and configs automatically.

10. **What databases and services back Satellite?**
    → PostgreSQL (database), Pulp (content), Katello (content & subscription), Candlepin (subscription service), Foreman (provisioning).
